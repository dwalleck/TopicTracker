# TopicTracker Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for TopicTracker, a high-performance AWS SNS mocking and testing library for .NET applications. The plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and leverages GitHub for task tracking and progress monitoring.

## Development Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: Every feature must have failing tests before implementation
2. **Railway-Oriented Programming**: All operations use Tethys.Results for error handling
3. **High Performance**: Target <100μs message capture latency
4. **Continuous Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates via GitHub Issues and Project boards

## GitHub Task Tracking Strategy

### Project Board Structure

We'll use GitHub Projects with the following columns:
- **Backlog**: All planned tasks
- **Ready**: Tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on (max 2 per developer)
- **In Review**: Code complete, awaiting review
- **Testing**: Integration and performance testing
- **Done**: Completed and merged
